## Introduction  
Hello, WELCOME!
Throughout this webpage I will be showing what I have learned throughout the last four weeks of class. In this page you will see charts, which provide pictures of where cases may be high or low for a period of time. I will also be describing what those charts say, and how to read them fully. 

## Data  
The Michigan COVID-19 data for this document were obtained at https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98163_98173---,00.html in the Public Use Datasets called "Cases by County and Date". The **December 29, 2021** dataset was used to create this report. Michigan county populations were found at https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-counties/states/mi which gives the 2018 census numbers. These were the most recent reliable numbers that I could find at the moment.

## Data munging
The Michigan COVID-19 dataset had a few peculiarities that needed to be dealt with in order to analyze it easily. There were several "counties" that are not actual Michigan counties that needed to be cleaned. The values for "Out-of-State" are not relevant for my purposes and were removed from the analyses. Likewise, prison populations ("FCI" and "MDOC") cannot be ascribed to particular counties and were, therefore, also removed. Cases with "Unknown" origins were also removed. Finally, the dataset lists "City of Detroit" as a separate entity, those numbers were added back into it's home country (Wayne) to facilitate analysis.

The number of cases and deaths per day are recorded for both confirmed and probable cases. To be as conservative as possible, these numbers were added together to create a total number of cases and deaths per day from each county (along with total cumulative cases and deaths). These total values, confirmed + probable, are used for all of the analyses in this report.

GIS information was left-joined onto the total data. The census data was also left-joined and used to create population-normalized values (cases or deaths per 100,000 population).

## Statewide distribution   
Describe and explain the distribution below:
Below there are two images. The first is the number of cases. As you can see the number of cases are mostly staying in one place. We know that all variants of Covid-19 spread easily and fast.

```{r state_map1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=12, fig.cap="**Figure 1:** CASES"}
mapDataA <- michiganTotalData %>% 
  group_by(Region) %>% 
  rename(region = Region) %>% 
  summarize(value = max(Cases.Cumulative))
mapDataA <- unique(mapDataA)

mapA <- county_choropleth(mapDataA, state_zoom = "michigan", num_colors = 1)

mapDataB <- michiganTotalData %>% 
  group_by(Region) %>% 
  rename(region = Region) %>% 
  summarize(value = max(Deaths.Cumulative))
mapDataB <- unique(mapDataB)

mapB <- county_choropleth(mapDataB, state_zoom = "michigan", num_colors = 1)
```


```{r state_map1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=12, fig.cap="**Figure 1:** CASES"}
ggarrange(mapA, mapB, labels = c("CASES", "DEATHS"), ncol = 1, nrow = 2, font.label = list(size = 28, color = "Brown", face = "bold", family = NULL))
```
## State Overall Trends
Using the county maps below as an example, create a figure showing cases for the entire state over time.
```{`{r state_plot, fig.cap="**Figure, fig.height=9, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
counties <- michiganTotalData %>% 
  filter(County == "huron" | County == "lake" | County == "jackson")
ggplot(michiganTotalData, aes(x=Cases, y=Date, color="pink", fill=County)) +
 

  scale_x_datetime(breaks = date_breaks("months"),labels = date_format("%b")) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_ma(ma_fun = EMA, n = 6, wilder = FALSE, linetype = 8, size = 10) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.POSIXct(as.Date(c("2019-04-02", "2019-09-17", "2020-08-31", "2020-09-07"))), linetype=8) +
  facet_grid(rows=vars(County), scales="free_y") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
    theme(axis.text=element_text(size=17),
        axis.title=element_text(size=18,face="bold"))

```



## Comparing Counties
Three counties that experienced different COVID incidences are Huron,Lake, and Jackson as you see I will compare them below.The vertical lines delimit the initial outbreak, alpha, delta, and omicron variants.

```{r state_plot, fig.cap="**Figure, fig.height=7, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
counties <- michiganTotalData %>% 
  filter(County == "huron" | County == "lake" | County == "jackson")
ggplot(michiganTotalData, aes(x=Cases, y=Date, color="pink", fill=County)) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c('lake'="firebrick", 'huron'="dodgerblue", 'jackson'="steelblue")) +
  scale_fill_manual(legend, values=c('lake'="firebrick", 'huron'="dodgerblue", 'jackson'="steelblue")) +
  scale_x_datetime(breaks = date_breaks("months"),labels = date_format("%b")) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_ma(ma_fun = EMA, n = 2, wilder = FALSE, linetype = 7, size = 8) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.POSIXct(as.Date(c("2019-04-02", "2019-09-17", "2020-08-31", "2020-09-07"))), linetype=8) +
  facet_grid(rows=vars(County), scales="free_y") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
    theme(axis.text=element_text(size=17),
        axis.title=element_text(size=18,face="bold"))
```

```{r weekly_county_plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=7, fig.cap="**Figure 6:** A comparison of the number of total cases in Huron, Lake, and Jackson counties month. The bars indicate total daily cases and the lines are four-week moving averages." }
counties <- monthly %>% 
  filter(County == "huron" | County == "lake" | County == "jackson")
ggplot(counties, aes(x=month, y=monthly.Cases, color=County, fill=County)) +
    scale_color_manual(values=c('lake'="firebrick", 'huron'="dodgerblue", 'jackson'="steelblue")) +
  scale_fill_manual(legend, values=c('lake'="firebrick", 'huron'="dodgerblue", 'jackson'="steelblue")) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_ma(ma_fun = EMA, n = 4, wilder = TRUE, linetype = 1, size = 2) +
  facet_grid(rows=vars(County), scales="free_y") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
    theme(axis.text=element_text(size=14),
        axis.title=element_text(size=18,face="bold"))
```

## Conclusions  
In conclusion, during these four weeks we have learned a lot. The data above shows that Covid-19 is still a very deadly and dangerous. In the graph avobe you can see that each county had a number of different spikes, or when the coronavirus specifically hit certain counties. This is an important part in research because it also shows how the virus comes in waves. The conclusion of this research is, still wear your mask and wash your hands regularly.
